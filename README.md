# Block Blast (for the fx-CG50)

Thijs project is a **recreation of Block Blast** using C and fxsdk for the fx-CG50 calculator.

Created using gint and fxsdk in the language C, this is my attempt to recreate Block Blast, a popular</br>
mobile game, for the fx-CG50 calculator. This is my first (and hopefully last) C project.

<h2>↓ Installation</h2>

### Requirements
- [Gint](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/gint) and [fxSDK](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/fxsdk) - both of these are relatively hard to install

### Commands
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/varunaditya-plus/cg50-blockblast.git
$ fxsdk build-cg
```

<h2>✰ About</h2>
This project was created as a proof of concept when I was wondering how hard it would be to code an Add-In for my new graphing calculator. It was very hard, even while leveraging AI to try to do some of the heavy lifting (like fonts). In the end, I'm very proud with the result of my efforts, and in the future I may try to recreate other games, or make my own for the calculator.
<br/><br/>Fun fact: To install gint and fxsdk, my mac couldn't handle it, so I had to install a Ubuntu virtual machine on VMWare Fusion and do all coding and testing on the VM. If you want to contribute or have any ideas, email me → me@varunaditya.xyz
